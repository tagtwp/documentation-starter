What is FTP?
============

[FTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_Transfer_Protocol) is a standard network protocol for downloading and uploading files from your computer to the server.

We recommend you to try [FileZilla](https://filezilla-project.org/), it’s free software and available for most popular platforms.

Using FileZilla software
------------------------

To use FileZilla software, follow the steps below:

1.  Download and install [FileZilla](https://filezilla-project.org/).
2.  Navigate to **File > Site Manager** and click on the **New Site** button. Set the login type as Normal. Then open panel in your hosting account to find **Hostname**, **port**, **username**, and **password**. Fill them in corresponding fields in FileZilla.
3.  Click on the **Connect** button. After that, a list of files and folders on the server will appear. Now you can edit files and folders from your local computer and upload them to the server.

Finding your FTP credentials
----------------------------

These details would mostly have been sent to you by your hosting provider, via email as soon as you created a domain.

#### Example FTP details
