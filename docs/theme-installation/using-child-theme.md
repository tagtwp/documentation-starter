A WordPress child theme is a WordPress theme that inherits its functionality from another WordPress theme, the parent theme. Child themes are often used when you want to customize or tweak an existing WordPress theme without losing the ability to upgrade the parent theme.

You can install the Child theme in the [same way](https://help.themeruby.com/foxiz/download-and-install-theme/) you have installed the main theme. you can add your custom code directly to Child Theme files to make changes appear on your site. These changes won’t be overwritten during updates.
